“Markup Language plus JavaScript”

## Description

This repository contains the materials, exercises, and resources for the course where you learn HTML (markup) plus JavaScript.
It’s structured to capture each activity/practice with code samples and solutions, helping you review and consolidate your skills in web development (HTML + CSS + JS).

## Contents

Here’s an overview of the main folders and files included:

* `Actividad1/ … Actividad8/` — Each folder corresponds to an activity, containing the assignment, source files, and a solution or working version.
* `Jquery/` and `Jquery2/` — Practice folders that focus on jQuery (or similar DOM-manipulation libraries) and how JS interacts with the markup.
* `myapp/` and `todo-app-in-native/` — More advanced or “mini-project” folders where you build a small application, applying what you’ve learned.
* `index.html`, `pruebas.html` — Example HTML pages to test, demo or prototype your scripts.
* `README.md` — This file (documentation).
* Other resources (CSS, images, maybe TypeScript) to support the exercises.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JuanSebastianPerniola/LDM-js.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the folder of the activity you want to open.
3. Open the HTML file (e.g., `index.html` or whichever in that activity) in a browser or IDE to see the markup and behaviour.
4. If you’re solving the activity yourself: copy the folder to your working environment, modify the code (HTML/JS), test it in the browser, commit your changes and push.
5. For the mini-apps (e.g., `todo-app-in-native/`), open them and try to interact, test, and extend them — perhaps add features, improve UI, etc.

## Best Practices

* Keep the original assignment statement alongside your solution files so someone reviewing knows what the exercise was.
* Use consistent and meaningful filenames (e.g., `Actividad5_Solution.html`, `todo_app.js`).
* Make commits often with descriptive messages (e.g., “Actividad 4 – implemented JS event handlers”, “Todo-app – added delete and filter functionality”).
* Test your pages in a browser to ensure everything works before committing/pushing.
* Comment your JS code when appropriate — explain what functions do, what events you handle, etc.

## Technology Stack

* HTML5 & CSS (Markup + styles)
* JavaScript (vanilla JS plus maybe TypeScript)
* DOM manipulation, event handling, maybe using libraries like jQuery (evident from the folders)
* Possibly native-app style JS (for the `todo-app-in-native` folder)
* Good practice for structuring code, modules, separation of concerns (markup vs script vs style).
